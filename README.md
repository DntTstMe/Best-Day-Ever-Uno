# Horiseon Semantic Overhaul

## Description 
This repository aids in the accessibility of a website.
* My motivation for this project was correcting a non-semantic HTML code and utilizing what I have learned to properly add the semantic elements. I also cleaned up the style sheet for easier navigation.
* I built this project to get a hands-on experience of the lastest skillset I have learned. Building this project helped me implement these skills.
* I solved future potential problems for other coders who  may have to navigate this code. A non-semantic code could cause problems and delay a project's deadline.
* I learned that there are many semantic elements that help a code become more easily read by others. I also learned that making a code cleaner than when you recieved it is beneficial.
* My project stands out because I made the website more accessible to everyone who uses it.
